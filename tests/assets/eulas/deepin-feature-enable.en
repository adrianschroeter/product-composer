WARNING: Deepin Dbus and policykit security issues

The deepin-feature-enable will help you to enable all feature of deepin-api and
deepin-daemon. 

For Ensuring your openSUSE is in security, We disable all the dbus and policykit
features for deepin-api and deepin-daemon, as well as the deepin-file-manager.
The SUSE security team thinks these dbus and policykit features are not secure.
But it leads to Deepin Desktop can not works fine, some features are invalid. If
you don't care about portential security issues, Please click "I agree" to can
enable Dbus and policykit feature for deepin-api and deepin-daemon. If you don't
know what are you doing, please click "I disagree" to exit this tool and read
https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Deepin carefully. Then you can manually run
deepin-api-dbus-installer, deepin-api-polkit-installer,
deepin-daemon-dbus-installer and deepin-daemon-polkit-installer with root to
enable these feature.

The deepin-feature-enable doesn't enable Dbus and policykit features for
deepin-file-manager. If you need them, please install deepin-file-dbus and
deepin-file-polkit. Then run deepin-file-dbus-installer and 
deepin-file-polkit-installer.
