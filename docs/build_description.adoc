== productcompose build description options

=== minimal version

 product_compose_schema: 0.2
 vendor: I_and_myself
 name: my_product
 version: 1.0
 product-type: module

 architectures: [ x86_64 ]

 packages:
  - my-single-rpm-package

=== build options

The build options may be used to change the behaviour of the build
process. The options are described in the details below.

Just add them to enable the desired functionality, no further
arguments are allowed.

=== flavors

Flavors can be defined with any name. These can be
used to build multiple media from one build description.

Each flavor may define an own architecture list.

It can also be used to add different package sets.

You need to add a _multibuild file to your sources
to enable the build.

=== iso

Enables iso file generation and requires configuration of
iso9660 headers.

=== content

content defines the packagesets to be used as entry
point for the medium.

The default is just to use the "main" packageset.

=== unpack

unpack defines the packagesets to be used for extracting
the content of the rpm packages directly on the medium.

These rpm packages need to provide these files below

 /usr/lib/skelcd/CD1

Currently it gets only extracted to the first/main medium,
but not on source or debug media.

=== packagesets

The packagesets definitions. A packageset lists rpm names
to be put on the medium.

There is usually one master list and in addition there
can be addional optional lists.

The additional lists can be filtered by flavors and/or
architectures.

The packageset requires at least a packages definition,
but may optionaly also a name, flavors or architectures.

==== name

Defines the name of the package set. 'main' is the default
name.

==== architecture

Lists the architectures where the set is to be used. The
default is for all architectures.

==== flavor

Lists the flavors where the set is to be used. The
default is for all flavors.

==== add

Can be used to add further packagesets by specifing
their names.

A special packageset called '__all__' will add all
package names local available.

==== sub

Can be used to remove packages from the specified
packageset names.

==== intersect

Can be used to filter packages with specified package
set lists.

==== packages

Lists all package names to be added. This is just the rpm
name, not the file name.

==== supportstatus

Define support status level for the packages listed in
packages. Valid support levels are l3, l2, unsupported.
However these are handled as strings. If the string starts
with a "=", it overrides any previously set support status
from inherited package sets.


=== Details

==== name

The product name.

==== version

The product version

==== version_from_package

A package name which will be used to determine the product version

==== update

Optional update level string for CPE

==== edition

Optional edition string for CPE

==== summary

The product name in explaining words. It will be presented to the
user on overview screens

==== product-type

Either 'base' for operation systems or 'module' for any product
depending on any existing installation.

'extension' is handled as alias for 'module'.

==== architectures

An array of the master architectures to be put into the repository.
This can be used to build a single repository usable for many
hardware architectures.

product composer will automatically fall back to "noarch" packages
if the package is not found natively.

Setting a global architecture list is optional, when architectures
are listed for each flavor.

==== bcntsynctag

Optionaly defines a bcntsynctag for OBS. OBS will sync the build
counter over all packages in same repository and architecture
according to this tag.

==== milestone

Optionaly defines a milestone which will be used by OBS at release
time. This can be used to turn candidate builds into a Beta1 for
example

==== build_options

===== take_all_available_versions

By default only "the best" version of each rpm is taken.
Use this switch to put all candidates on the medium.
For example for maintenance repositories.

===== OBS_unordered_product_repos

OBS is by default filtering rpm packages based on the repository
path layering.

This switch can be used to disable this behaviour in cases where
a binary from a lower priorisated repository should be used.

This can increase the amount of required binaries a lot when
dealing with deep path lists.

===== ignore_missing_packages

Missing packages lead by default to a build failure.
Use this switch to continue. The missing packages are
still listed in the build log.

===== hide_flavor_in_product_directory_name

The flavor name is by default part of the directory
name of the build result. This can be disabled,
when each flavor has a different arch list. Otherwise
conflicts can happen.

===== add_slsa_provenance

Add slsa provenance files for each rpm if available

===== abort_on_empty_updateinfo

Existing updateinfo.xml are scanned by default and reduced to
the available package binaries. In case none are found the
update is skipped. Enableing this option leads to a build failure
instead.

===== skip_updateinfos

No updateinfo meta information is added to the media.
This might be required when not using take_all_available_versions,
but building on a former released code base.

===== updateinfo_packages_only

Build a pure update repository. Skipping all matching rpms
which are not referenced via an updateinfo.

===== base_skip_packages

Controls whether packages should be copied in the `/install` directory
when using base iso images.

Enabling this would result in a simply repacked base image, without
any package copied there.

==== iso

===== publisher

For setting the iso9660 PUBLISHER header

===== vendor_id

For setting the iso9660 VENDOR_ID header

===== tree

Can be set to "drop" for creating only the iso files.

===== base

Can be used to copy the result into a pre generated iso file.
product-composer itself is not creating bootable iso images,
aka installer images. But it can used for example to use iso
images with the agama-installer where it copies the main tree
inside.

When defining a base iso name, it is expected that:
 * the image gets provided via an rpm called baseiso-NAME
 * the image is available in the /usr/libexec/base-isos directory
   with the given NAME prefix.

product-composer will add the main product tree into /install
directory of this media. The build result will be a single
iso file name with the product name and a .install.iso suffix.

Only a single repository per product is usable. In case source
or debug rpm's need to be added, they need to be part of the
main repository.

==== installcheck

Runs a repository closure test for each architecture. This will
report any missing dependencies and abort.

===== ignore_errors

For reporting the dependency errors, but ignoring them.

==== debug

Configure the handling of debuginfo and debugsource rpms.
Use either

  debug: include

to include them or

  debug: drop

to drop all debug packages or

  debug: split

to create a seperate medium mwith -Debug suffix.

Missing debug packages will always be ignored.

This default setting may get specified per flavor.

==== packages

The package list. It can contain either simple name or it can
be extended by a >, >=, =, <, <= operator to specify a
specific version constraint.

The syntax for the version is rpm like

 [EPOCH:]VERSION[-RELEASE]

A missing epoch means epoch zero. If the release is missing, it
matches any release.

The package list can be valid globally or limited to specific flavors
or architectures.

==== product_compose_schema

Defines the level of the yaml syntax.
Please expect incompatible changes at any time atm.

This will be used to provide backward compability once
we stabilized.

==== product_directory_name

Can be used to specify a directory or medium name manually.
The default is "name-version".

The directory name will always be suffixed by the architecture
and build number.

==== source

Configure the handling of src or nosrc rpms for the picked binaries.
Use either

  source: include

to include all source packages or

  source: drop

to drop all source packages or

  source: split

to create a seperate medium with -Source suffix.

A missing source package leads to a build failure unless
the ignore_missing_packages built option is used.

This default setting may get specified per flavor.

==== repodata

Write architecture specific repository meta data into the architecture
specific sub directories. This way a client needs to process less
data. The disadvantage is that different URL's need to be handled
per architecture.

  repodata: split

It is also possible to have a main repodata including all architectures
in addition to the architecture splitted ones.

  repodata: all

In absence of the repodata element only the main repodata is created
and includes all architectures.

This may get specified per flavor.

==== vendor

Defines the company responsible for the content. Can be for example
openSUSE or SUSE. It is used by the install stack.

==== set_updateinfo_from

Can be set to replace the "from" attribute in updateinfo.xml files with a fixed value.
This is shown as patch provider by zypp stack. Otherwise the value stays, OBS is setting
the packager from _patchinfo file here by default.

==== set_updateinfo_id_prefix

Sets a fixed prefix to all id's of included updateinfo data. It is not adding again
if the prefix exists already.

This can be used to have a common identifier for an update for many products, but
still being able to identify the filtering for a specific product.

==== block_updates_under_embargo

The current default is to include maintenance updates under embargo. This option can
be set to abort when an embargo date is in future.
